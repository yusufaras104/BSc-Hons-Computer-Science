        "1. The function initializes two empty lists, ***'names'*** and ***'count'***, to store the candidate names and the corresponding vote counts, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. A while loop is used to continuously prompt the user for votes until they enter \"-1\" or leave the input empty. This loop breaks when the user indicates the end of voting.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inside the loop, the function checks if the entered vote is already in the ***'names'*** list. If so, it finds the index of the candidate in the list and increments the corresponding vote count in the ***'count'*** list.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. If the entered vote is not in the ***'names'*** list, it adds the candidate name to the ***'names'*** list and initializes their vote count to 1 in the ***'count'*** list.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. After the voting process, the function checks if any votes were cast by verifying the length of the ***'names'*** list. If the list is empty, it displays a message indicating that no votes were cast.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. If votes were cast, the function determines the maximum number of votes received using the ***'max()'*** function on the ***'count'*** list. It then identifies the ***'winner(s)'*** by creating a list, winners, containing the names of candidates whose vote count matches the maximum votes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The function proceeds to display the vote tally by iterating over the **'names'*** and ***'count'*** lists simultaneously using the ***'zip()'*** function. It prints each candidate's name and their corresponding vote count.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Finally, the function checks the length of the ***'winners'*** list. If there is only one winner, it displays a message announcing the winner's name and the number of votes they received. If there is a tie between multiple winners, it prints a message indicating a tie and lists the winners' names along with the maximum vote count."
